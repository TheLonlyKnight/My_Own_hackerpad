Libraries required

- Keypad (by Mark Stanley / Alexander Brevig)
- Adafruit SSD1306 (by Adafruit)
- Adafruit GFX Library (by Adafruit)
- Bounce2 (by Thomas O Fredericks)
- Encoder (by Paul Stoffregen)

Notes:
- In the Arduino IDE open Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries... and search for each name above.
- I added a polling-based encoder implementation in the sketch when `ENCODER_DO_NOT_USE_INTERRUPTS` is defined to avoid AVR-only code; if you want the original Encoder library behavior, install "Encoder" and remove `#define ENCODER_DO_NOT_USE_INTERRUPTS` from the top of the sketch.
- Keep the `lib/` folder if you have local libraries; otherwise Library Manager is the recommended way to install.
