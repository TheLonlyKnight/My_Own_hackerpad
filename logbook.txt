Got to read more in the hackpad https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide then -> faq then resources will watch the videos there as tutorial. Ima thinking of following the guide to learn so it is easier to add my own changes later will need to understand it because i just read about 10 min woth of the document so far picked it because will not do the same mistake as in hackclub of never deciding or not adding work.

Just read that Highway has it is starter so idk anymore. my luck "nvm it was in blueprint as starter project idk anymore will just read more about making hackpad learned that highWay was hackclub but before that or like on the same time but it is over so i don't need to care"

Finished the resources part another 10 min will watch the youtube tutorials video starts with "i recommend you watch that video" Iam in a loop that never ends hackpad recommend new pages before i read 10 lines nvm it was a 3min video "i knew that already but nvm"
