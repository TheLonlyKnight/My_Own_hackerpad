## 10/26/2025 1 AM - Looking over what HackPad is  

Got to read more in the hackpad https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide then -> faq then resources will watch the videos there as tutorial. Ima thinking of following the guide to learn so it is easier to add my own changes later will need to understand it because i just read about 10 min woth of the document so far picked it because will not do the same mistake as in hackclub of never deciding or not adding work.

Finished the resources part another 10 min will watch the youtube tutorials video starts with "i recommend you watch that video" Iam in a loop that never ends hackpad recommend new pages before i read 10 lines nvm it was a 3min video "i knew that already but nvm"

hour passed finished How to Design Mechanical Keyboard PCBs with Kicad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ will follow it when the kicad installs and get the get lebiry will end it here the clock is 1:30 and wifi got slow "cant even run wifi speed test" was not able to finish emplenting the video but got to prepare the softwere and kicad crached when trying to add a plug in for the video
iam setting the rest for tomorrow because this speed is not great

## 10/26/2025 12 PM - Finished 2 tutorials in hackpad Resources   

did the video to the end matched its steps and watched the other. Got better understanding and will think of how to change the hackpad to make it special might add some stuff but will first need to continue looking into the controller.

good stuff
Learned kicad "only 1 example done and it is keyboard example :)"

bad stuff 
still dont know how i want to change the original hackpad dont even know what a hackpad is only that it has 4 keys and how it is made  -> looked more into it might add a screen witch i use with a desktop app to controll what is displayed like "task major or a small thing so i can use the keys on the pad to interact and change what shows like Trex borwser game or stuff on a screen will have to look into it".


time spent 2h

## 10/30/2025 - Produced design, finished pcb  

i got to punder about what to add extra and chose a screen and looked at how stuff will work"I2C protocol" bc that was what the screen uses kinda useless if i dont have other stuff connected.
choose to use the xiao 2040 chip the same from the hackpad becouse idk no reason seemd fine also got 3 pins left and wanted to add an rotary encoder but choose because would not fit in a small rectangle could have hade it where i have the xiao chip but wanted to have the chip visible or at least for now "might change it later" ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njc1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4502dace5d4fcb15d480948865aa12e252c7b46e/image.png)

i did look for the chip part and the screen

why i did not choose the rotary is cant find the rotary it self it is allways on a pcb or the pins are not marked used temu to look for them.

if someone reads this pls help with where to get the pcb? "i have seen jlc and they have a good website and look to be a good company but the shiping is like 20$"
